//Ex. 1
/*
Write a function called createCounter. 
This function should contain a variable count that is initialized to 0. 
This function should return another function that when invoked, 
increments the counter by 1 and returns the count variable. 
You should be able to create multiple counters with the createCounter function 
and they should all have their own private variable called count.
